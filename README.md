# Film-Finder-Game
Catching up on your list of TV shows and movies and want to get recommendations for what to watch next, but aren’t sure where to look? This game was created with the knowledge of HTTP requests and asynchronous JavaScript to create a movie discovery app that will recommend random movies by genre.  You’ll be able to choose from several genres, and like or dislike a movie to get another suggestion.

Created with html, css, javascript, and ran by node.
